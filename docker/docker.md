When you create an image, you stuff your software into a container image. When a machine runs that image, a container is created. Container images and containers can be managed in a standardized way, which allows for standard solutions during a containerized software’s lifecycle:

* common build chain
* common image storage
* common way to deploy and scale-up
* common hosting of running containers
* common control and monitoring of running containers
* common ways to update running containers to a new version
